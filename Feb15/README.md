## Steps
* Created the inner and outer circles
* Created the class for the cabin and put new instances of the class in an array
* The class involved making lines and the cabin from the center with a certain angle, i did that using the sine and cosine ratios
* Then rotating just needed incrementing the angle of each cabin by 0.1 in each iteration
* I gave random colours to each cabin
* Then drew the sun using a simple circle


## Difficulties
This project was very interesting because i thought it will take me a while to figure out how to move the carts like an actual ferris wheel ( rotating them while also translating them in circular motion) but just using the angle property for the cabins and then subsequently sine and cosine to position the cabins worked very smoothly.
