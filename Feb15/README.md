## Steps
* Created the inner and outer circles
* Created the class for the cabin and put new instances of the class in an array
* The class involved making lines and the cabin from the center with a certain angle, i did that using the sine and cosine ratios
* Then rotating just needed incrementing the angle of each cabin by 0.1 in each iteration
* I gave random colours to each cabin
* Then drew the sun using a simple circle

I didnt face any such difficulty as I have worked previously worked with OOP before but an interesting thing i noticed that even though my ferris wheel rotates it does not use the rotate function but rather just giving an angle property to the object and incrementing it worked for me
