# The Idea
Our idea of the final project revolves around the concept of using arduino to count the number of people present in a room at a time. Our initial idea was to use only one motion sensor connected to the arduino to detect movement in and out of the room but soon we realized that it would be hard to differentiate between people entering and exiting the room. So courtesy of our friend Emaan, we now plan to install three motion sensors, one on one side of the door, one on the other side and one over the door. The sensor on top of the door will ensure that the person actually passed the door and sensors on either sides of the door will help differentiate whether the person entered or exited based on the order in which they are activated. Then we will use p5js to analyse and model the data gathered from the arduino. And if it is implemented and a substantial amount of data is gathered, machine learning models can be used to predict the number of people at a certain time on a certain day which could be helpful for decision making such as in the library.
