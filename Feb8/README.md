# Colla*r*tz Conjecture


Collatz Conjecture, which I thought was pronounced as Coll**art**z Conjecture until very long, asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. Its something that is seemingly so simple but mathematicians have no clue yet how to go about proving it. But when modelled using code, it shows patterns which are breathtaking and have a stark resemblance to patterns found in nature. It is given by the following notation:

However since **3*n+1** will always be an even number, we can speeden up the process to see faster growing patterns by this modified notation:
