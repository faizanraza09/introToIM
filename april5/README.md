# Description
The two types of ciruits in my homework involve these:
## Digital Input
The circuit takes digital input from the pushbutton switch and it acts as a state changer like in fairy lights. The first time you click the button the led turns on, the second time you click the button the led starts blinking, the third time you click the button the light starts fading in and out and the fourth time you click the button the led turns off and then this repeats
## Analog Input
The circuit takes analog input from the ldr sensor and the led gets dimmer if there is more surrounding light and brighter if there is lesser surrounding light

# Process
First off all i tried to create
