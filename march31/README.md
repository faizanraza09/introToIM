# The Book Switch

## Concept
The primary concept of this switch is very simple, if you close the book the light turns on and if you open the book the light turns off signalling that stoppping studying and closing the book brings joy in life.


## Process
First i made a basic circuit with a led and a resistor with ends of two wires unconnected. The black wire comes from the ground input in the arduino and is attached into the negative column. Then the negative end of the led is connected to the negative column and the positive end is connected in j18. The resistor is then connected from f18 to f10. Then the other end of the wire (green) from h10 is taped to copper wire and then taped to one page of the book, then the remaining copper wire is taped on the same page. Then another wire (red) is also taped to the copper wire and then taped to the other page and some copper wire is also taped on that page. The other end of the red wire is inserted into the 5v input.

## Problems
My initial plan was to use aluminium foil instead of the copper wires but the im lab did not have it so the lab assistant suggested to use copper tape. But the copper tape wasnt conductive enough and when two copper tapes touched each other the current wasnt strong enough to complete the circuit. So i just used the next best available option which was the copper wire.
